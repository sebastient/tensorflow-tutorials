    "2. Provides a template for constructing larger and more sophisticated models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason CIFAR-10 was selected was that it is complex enough to exercise\n",

    "the model is small enough to train fast, which is ideal for trying out\n",
    "new ideas and experimenting with new techniques.\n",
