    "## Softmax Regressions\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that every image in MNIST is a digit, whether it's a zero or a nine. We\n",
    "want to be able to look at an image and give probabilities for it being each\n",
    "digit. For example, our model might look at a picture of a nine and be 80% sure\n",
    "it's a nine, but give a 5% chance to it being an eight (because of the top loop)\n",
    "and a bit of probability to all the others because it isn't sure.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a classic case where a softmax regression is a natural, simple model.\n",
    "If you want to assign probabilities to an object being one of several different\n",
    "things, softmax is the thing to do. Even later on, when we train more\n",
    "sophisticated models, the final step will be a layer of softmax.\n",
    "\n",
    "A softmax regression has two steps: first we add up the evidence of our input\n",
    "being in certain classes, and then we convert that evidence into probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "To tally up the evidence that a given image is in a particular class, we do a\n",
    "weighted sum of the pixel intensities. The weight is negative if that pixel\n",
    "having a high intensity is evidence against the image being in that class,\n",
    "and positive if it is evidence in favor.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following diagram shows the weights one model learned for each of these\n",
    "classes. Red represents negative weights, while blue represents positive\n",
    "weights.\n",

    "<img style=\"width:100%\" src=\"images/softmax-weights.png\">\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "We also add some extra evidence called a bias. Basically, we want to be able\n",
    "to say that some things are more likely independent of the input. The result is\n",
    "that the evidence for a class \\\\(i\\\\) given an input \\\\(x\\\\) is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{evidence}_i = \\sum_j W_{i,~ j} x_j + b_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where \\\\(W_i\\\\) is the weights and \\\\(b_i\\\\) is the bias for class \\\\(i\\\\),\n",
    "and \\\\(j\\\\) is an index for summing over the pixels in our input image \\\\(x\\\\).\n",
    "We then convert the evidence tallies into our predicted probabilities\n",
    "\\\\(y\\\\) using the \"softmax\" function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y = \\text{softmax}(\\text{evidence})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here softmax is serving as an \"activation\" or \"link\" function, shaping\n",
    "the output of our linear function into the form we want -- in this case, a\n",
    "probability distribution over 10 cases.\n",
    "You can think of it as converting tallies\n",
    "of evidence into probabilities of our input being in each class.\n",
    "It's defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{softmax}(x) = \\text{normalize}(\\exp(x))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If you expand that equation out, you get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{softmax}(x)_i = \\frac{\\exp(x_i)}{\\sum_j \\exp(x_j)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "But it's often more helpful to think of softmax the first way:\n",
    "exponentiating its inputs and then normalizing them.\n",
    "The exponentiation means that one more unit of evidence increases the weight\n",
    "given to any hypothesis multiplicatively.\n",
    "And conversely, having one less unit of evidence means that a\n",
    "hypothesis gets a fraction of its earlier weight. No hypothesis ever has zero\n",
    "or negative weight. Softmax then normalizes these weights, so that they add up\n",
    "to one, forming a valid probability distribution. (To get more intuition about\n",
    "the softmax function, check out the\n",

    "on it in Michael Nieslen's book, complete with an interactive visualization.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You can picture our softmax regression as looking something like the following,\n",
    "although with a lot more \\\\(x\\\\)s. For each output, we compute a weighted sum of\n",
    "the \\\\(x\\\\)s, add a bias, and then apply softmax.\n",
