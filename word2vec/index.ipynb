    "\n",
    "This tutorial is meant to highlight the interesting, substantive parts of\n",
    "building a word2vec model in TensorFlow.\n",

    "* We start by giving the motivation for why we would want to\n",
    "represent words as vectors.\n",

    "(with a splash of math for good measure).\n",
    "* We also show a simple implementation of the model in TensorFlow.\n",

    "which is a more serious implementation that showcases some more advanced\n",
    "TensorFlow principles about how to efficiently use threads to move data into a\n",
    "text model, how to checkpoint during training, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "But first, let's look at why we would want to learn word embeddings in the first\n",
    "place. Feel free to skip this section if you're an Embedding Pro and you'd just\n",
    "like to get your hands dirty with the details.\n",

    "## Motivation: Why Learn Word Embeddings?\n",
    "\n",
    "Image and audio processing systems work with rich, high-dimensional datasets\n",
    "encoded as vectors of the individual raw pixel-intensities for image data, or\n",
    "e.g. power spectral density coefficients for audio data. For tasks like object\n",
    "or speech recognition we know that all the information required to successfully\n",
    "perform the task is encoded in the data (because humans can perform these tasks\n",
    "from the raw data).  However, natural language processing systems traditionally\n",
    "treat words as discrete atomic symbols, and therefore 'cat' may be represented\n",
    "as  `Id537` and 'dog' as `Id143`.  These encodings are arbitrary, and provide\n",
    "no useful information to the system regarding the relationships that may exist\n",
    "between the individual symbols. This means that the model can leverage\n",
    "very little of what it has learned about 'cats' when it is processing data about\n",
    "'dogs' (such that they are both animals, four-legged, pets, etc.). Representing\n",
    "words as unique, discrete ids furthermore leads to data sparsity, and usually\n",
    "means that we may need more data in order to successfully train statistical\n",
    "models.  Using vector representations can overcome some of these obstacles.\n",

    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "[Vector space models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space_model) (VSMs)\n",
    "represent (embed) words in a continuous vector space where semantically\n",
    "similar words are mapped to nearby points ('are embedded nearby each other').\n",
    "VSMs have a long, rich history in NLP, but all methods depend in some way or\n",
    "another on the\n",
    "[Distributional Hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributional_semantics#Distributional_Hypothesis),\n",
    "which states that words that appear in the same contexts share\n",
    "semantic meaning. The different approaches that leverage this principle can be\n",
    "divided into two categories: *count-based methods* (e.g.\n",
    "[Latent Semantic Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_semantic_analysis)),\n",
    "and *predictive methods* (e.g.\n",

    "models are similar, except that CBOW predicts target words (e.g. 'mat') from\n",
    "source context words ('the cat sits on the'), while the skip-gram does the\n",
    "inverse and predicts source context-words from the target words. This inversion\n",
    "might seem like an arbitrary choice, but statistically it has the effect that\n",
    "CBOW smoothes over a lot of the distributional information (by treating an\n",
    "entire context as one observation). For the most part, this turns out to be a\n",
    "useful thing for smaller datasets. However, skip-gram treats each context-target\n",
    "pair as a new observation, and this tends to do better when we have larger\n",

    "Our vanilla implementation showcases the flexibility of TensorFlow. For\n",
    "example, changing the training objective is as simple as swapping out the call\n",
    "to `tf.nn.nce_loss()` for an off-the-shelf alternative such as\n",
    "`tf.nn.sampled_softmax_loss()`. If you have a new idea for a loss function, you\n",
    "can manually write an expression for the new objective in TensorFlow and let\n",
    "the optimizer compute its derivatives. This flexibility is invaluable in the\n",
    "exploratory phase of machine learning model development, where we are trying\n",
    "out several different ideas and iterating quickly.\n",

    "Once you have a model structure you're satisfied with, it may be worth\n",
    "optimizing your implementation to run more efficiently (and cover more data in\n",
    "less time).  For example, the naive code we used in this tutorial would suffer\n",
    "compromised speed because we use Python for reading and feeding data items --\n",
    "each of which require very little work on the TensorFlow back-end.  If you find\n",

    "In this tutorial we covered the word2vec model, a computationally efficient\n",
    "model for learning word embeddings. We motivated why embeddings are useful,\n",
    "discussed efficient training techniques and showed how to implement all of this\n",
    "in TensorFlow. Overall, we hope that this has show-cased how TensorFlow affords\n",
